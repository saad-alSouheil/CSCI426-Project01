      <h2>About Our Platform</h2>

      <p>
        This platform was created to make communication between doctors and
        patients easier and faster. Patients can post questions, share concerns,
        and learn from others — while doctors can provide reliable guidance and
        clarify medical topics.
      </p>

      <p>
        Our goal is to help users:
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li>Get quick medical insights</li>
        <li>Ask health-related questions</li>
        <li>Share experiences</li>
        <li>Stay informed with trustworthy information</li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        This app is not a replacement for real medical diagnosis, but a space
        for learning and guidance.
